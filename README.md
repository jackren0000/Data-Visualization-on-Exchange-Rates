### **Visualizing Euro Exchange Rates (っ＾▿＾)💨**

Ever wondered how the value of the euro has changed over time? In this project, we take a deep dive into the euro exchange rate, with a special focus on its relationship with the US dollar. We'll be using data visualization to uncover trends and patterns in the data.

#### **Our Journey 🗺️**

1.  **Data Wrangling 🤠:** The dataset was a bit messy at first. We had to:
    *   Rename some columns to make them more user-friendly.
    *   Convert the date column to a proper `datetime` format.
    *   Sort the data by date to get a chronological view.
    *   Isolate the Euro-to-USD exchange rate data.

2.  **Visualizing the Trends 📈:** With our clean data, we created a line plot to see how the Euro-to-USD exchange rate has evolved from 1999 to 2022. This visualization helps us see the bigger picture, cutting through the noise of daily fluctuations.

#### **Tech Stack 🛠️**

*   Python
*   Pandas & NumPy
*   Matplotlib & Seaborn
*   Jupyter Notebook
